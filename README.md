# Multiplayer RPG
A multiplayer RPG-style game project created during weeks 4 to 6.

Players are able to sign-up and sign-in using basic authentication. Upon sign-in, players are able to move, attack and chat with one another globally and privately using whispers '@player'. The game was developed with a node.js server connected to a MongoDB Atlas database. Client-server communication is handled with socket.io. 

The game is inspired and based on Raining Chain.
